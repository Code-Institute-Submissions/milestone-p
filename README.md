    I based my project on my favourite band, Nickelback. 
	 
	 My goal was to create a easy user experience website for my target audience which was all ages.
	 
	 
	 Credit to my mentor and the code institute community on Slack.
	 
	 I would like to give credit to the websites I got help from when working on my project:

	  *W3 Schools : I got most of my bootstrap code here, nav bar, fade photo (index page) 
      *MD bootstrap.com : footer

	  *Youtube- video links
	  *Facebook
	  *Twitter
