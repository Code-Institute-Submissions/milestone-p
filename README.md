  # My Milestone Project

  
## UX
    
    I based my project on my favourite band, Nickelback. 
	 
	My goal was to create a easy user experience website for my target audience which was all ages.
	
	I have video content of the band linked from their own Youtube channel. 
	 
---------------------

## Features 

   My website contains 4 pages, Home, About, News, Videos.
   
   I have a click and scroll featured on two pages I implemented this by using JavaScript. I have the scroll button feature on the index page only set to work on desktop. Not mobile and tablet screens.
   
   I used bootstrap to make my website responsive for different devices.
