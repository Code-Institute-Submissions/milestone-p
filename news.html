 <h1> Top Story | This Month </h1>

<p> We got in touch with one lucky fan who's dream came true thanks to <a href="https://www.overdrive.ie/">"Overdrive.ie".</a> Who posted a Facebook competition to send one winner to meet and greet the band and enjoy the show with backstage passes.</p> 
<p> Here we will hear from the girl herself. </p>
<p> That's when Louise was chosen amongst the many people who tried to get their hands on the prize. </p>
<p class="fan"> Louise: <strong> "When they announced on Facebook who the winner was and I read my name , I don't know how many times I reread the announcement, it was such a surreal moment, the whole experience was from there.." </strong> </p> 
<p class="journalist"> Journalist: <strong> Was there tears of joy?? </strong> </p> <p class="fan">Louise:<strong>"Oh yes, of course, it was such an unreal moment, it's really hard to describe, I really can't put into words." </strong> </p>
 <p class="journalist"> Journalist: <strong> "How did you cope meeting them in person if the news was all that much to you..haha??" </strong> </p> 
 <p class="fan"> Louise: <strong>"Honestly I made sure I prepared myself before hand, I really thought about wanting to make a good impression so I wanted to make sure I wouldn't loose my cool and cry! I also wanted to go the extra mile in hope they might remember me..haha So I got a hoody personalised. Which has this cool black printed photo of the band which I found online. Then on the back it says ("been a fan since I was five").."</strong> </p> 
 
 <p class="journalist">  Journalist: <strong> "Awwwe, that is so sweet, it definitely sounds like you put alot of thought in and well did it pay off when you met them? Tell us about meeting them, Please !" </strong> </p>
 
 <p class="fan"> Louise: <strong> "Well yes I managed not to cry but I also managed not to say anything to them at all !! I was speechless, completely starstruck. As I went to shake each of their hand, I did my best to beat the shyness and take in the moment that they were right there infront of me. My mind went to completely blank,
 all I managed to say was how great it was to meet them.. Ryan Peake did compliment my hoody and they all agreed with him that it was cool. That meant alot and sure getting in a photo with them was incredible and it's like a resurrance it was real and not a dream !! haha Who knew a short amount of time could mean so much, a life time.." </strong> </p>
 
 <p class="journalist"> Journalist: <strong> I could imagine it being very overwhelming, it's not everyday and everyone meeting their idols. Last thing any disapointments or are they what you'd expect in person?" </strong> </p>
 
 <p class="fan"> Louise: <strong> I was disapointed I couldn't tell them more, I would have loven to express how much they've made me happy over the years, how they've influenced music, I really appreciate band music and that that started with them. But I can hand on heart say I walked away proud, they were complete gentlemen and down to earth.
    It's such a better feeling when I listen to them now, I have the surreal reality that I met them and when I go to other concerts , let's just say nothing has topped the experience I had that night. " </strong> </p>
